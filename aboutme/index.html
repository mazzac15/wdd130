   <h2>Cindy Mazza</h2>
   <p>Hi! I'm Cindy. I am excited to be starting school again. I am working towards a degree in Applied Technology. When not doing school work, I am an uber driver for my 3 kids, work on home improvement projects, and listen to the waves at the beach.  </p>
   <p>I was baptized at 8 years old a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. I served a mission to Cordoba Argentina shortly after met my husband who lived most of his life in Argentina. We are a mate drinking, empanada eating family and I love it!</p> 
   <p> President Russell M Nelson said, "When your greatest desire is to let God prevail...you know what you want to accomplish. You know the kind of person you really want to become."</p>
   <p>I want to let God prevail in my life. In following His council for me, I am back at school to aquire the skills needed to be a resource to my family. I am grateful for BYU-Idaho and the Pathways program for giving me the opportunity to continue my education.</p>
